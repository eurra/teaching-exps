# Some teaching experiences
> *Author*: Enrique Urra - enrique.urra@gmail.com

This is a small repository, or portfolio, in which I share some meaningful ideas and experiences from several years of teaching computer science, informatics and engineering, mainly to undergraduate students of different universities and programs. 

To teach programming in this context is a real challenge for enthusiasts and practitioners, because it forces you to think about how you are actually thinking when coding, and how you are abstracting in your mind a strange world of data structures, low-level instructions and program flow regarding a specific problem at hand. It is really important to *visualize* in some way how a program is operating, or how you really expect it to operate, and to show that to other people with diverse methods of thinking and learning. Because of that, you will see in these examples a lot of visual elements that try to provide a bridge between programming concepts and a concrete practice of solving problems with code.

The examples that I share address both perspectives of **content** and **methodology**. The first is related to material and resources that I produced in time for teaching specific programming concepts. The latter is related to methods that I applied and improved in time for improving the learning experience of students regarding specific contexts.

At the start of each example, a brief bottom line is presented. Also, consider that most teaching artifacts and examples are provided in spanish, because I taught programming in such language in the past. Don't worry, they are explained in a way that the visuals are more important than text.
